       A.
         For my building worlds final, I'm building an interactive illustrator based off science fiction genre . 
 The story I'm going to use is Time Machine by H.G Wells.The user will be able to travel thought different times zones
 and view  different  time scenes . Overall i would like the to have the interaction in scenes  affect your time travel.
 
       B.
	This going to take a lot of scripting; relate to where the traveler is at what light is on, 
what is instantiate in the scene, implementing a cause and effect that changes things in different scenes, 
little bit of rigging and animation.
	
       c.	
        This is relating back to ways of seeing by John Bergen. Taking an old narrative using modern technology to visual that
 narrative, interrupting its mean, express  concern of that future technology that the narrative uses and also use unity to
 explore the possibility of how that technology might work even thought it does not exist yet.
